    Notify tech support when an Interactive analysis fails

    Interactive users aren't expected to track the status of their job requests
    in job-server because we show them a higher level interface, so it's
    reasonable to think they would not be monitoring for failed jobs.  A failed
    job for an Interactive request also likely represents a bug since the code
    is written by OpenSAFELY, and tech support will triage this for us.
