    # we compile the development dependencies we stay consistent with the current
    # production dependencies. However it's still possible, by doing things in a certain
    # order, to accidentally end up with divergent versions. This can lead to confusion
    # and makes the actual installed set of packages dependent on the order in which the
    # files are read, which is bad.

    # The below test ensures that wherever the two files specify the same dependency
    # they agree on the version.
