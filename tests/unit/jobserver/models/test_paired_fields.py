"""
The tests in this module test paired fields: two fields with different suffixes that
share a stem. The most common paired fields are "at" and "by" fields, such as
`Repo.internal_signed_off_at` and `Repo.internal_signed_off_by`. In this example, the
different suffixes "_at" and "_by" share the stem "internal_signed_off".

Paired fields are important because of their constraints. In the following table, rows
represent values of one field in a pair; columns represent values of the other field in
the pair. "Pass" indicates that we expect the model to save (i.e. the constraints should
pass); "fail" indicates that we don't expect the model to save, and that we expect an
`IntegrityError` to be raised (i.e. the constraints should fail).

        | None     | Value |
|-------|----------|-------|
| None  | pass*    | fail  |
| Value | fail     | pass  |

*Only when both fields are optional.

In this module, we often need to provide collections of models and fields. For
convenience, we do so with a list of tuples. The first item in the tuple is the model
label, which is a string. The remaining items in the tuple are the field names, which
are also strings. If only the model label is given, then all field names are assumed.
