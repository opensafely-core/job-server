# 17. Publishing interactive reports
Date: 2023-04-10

## Status

Deprecated (see [ADR 29](0029-sunset-osi-interactive.md), sunsetting Interactive.

## Context
We already have a process for publishing outputs via the Snapshot models and the outputs-viewer.
However for a report the rendering of a given HTML file matters.
We also want to better model the process of a user requesting that an object on our platform is made public.
We know this usually comes with some back and forth, and so baking that into the platform will help out both researchers and staff.


## Decision
We will add a flow for users to request that a given file, and by extension the report related to it, is made public.


## Consequences
We can provide staff a queue of requests to deal with.
Teams will be able to handle those as they see fit.

By modelling the request process, and not just the input/output states, we can track various metrics inherent to that process, for example time to decision might be useful to teams who deal with these requests.
