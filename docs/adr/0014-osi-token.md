# 14. Github token set up for OSI
Date: 2023-03-24

## Status
Deprecated

## Context

For OSI, job-server needs to be able to write generated code to Github.
Previously, job-server only had read access to repos, as a security control.
Granting arbitrary repo write permissions to job-server weakens the security
layering, as it increases the possible attack vectors of what compromising
job-server alone can do.

The current read-only access is provided by the opensafely-readonly bot
account, as classic PATs cannot be restricted to read only access in any other
way.

We explored the new fine-grained PATs, but you can only restrict access to an
explict list of repos, which mean we'd need to update or regenerate the token
every time we added a new interactive study.


## Decision

We created an [Interactive
team](https://github.com/orgs/opensafely/teams/interactive/members) in the
opensafely org. We added the pre-existing `opensafely-interactive-bot` as
a member of this team.

When we create a new interactive repo, we automatically add it to this team
with `write` permissions. This means a classic PAT generated by the
opensfely-interactive-bot user can only write to those repos.


## Consequences

Job-server now has a token than can write to repos. It is at least
restricted to writing to interactive repos, and cannot access user's repos.

This unblocks OSIv2, but it does however remove the layer of protection we had
originaly designed.  A compromised job-server can now run arbitrary code in any
backend. We still have our other layers of protection (Level 4 access
controls), so this is not critical.

However, in the long term, we should consider moving the committing part of OSI
out to a separate secure service, to restore this layer of protection.
