    Redirect users without `fullname` set to the settings page

    We get a User's username from GitHub when they register with the site.  If
    their GitHub profile has a name set we also get that, however we have many
    (~50% at time of writing) users who have not set that.  We want to require
    all users have their name set.  This middleware redirects any user with an
    empty `fullname` value to their settings page.

    We exempt various URL prefixes which don't make sense to do this on, eg if
    we're not expecting traditional users there or it doesn't make sense for
    the UX (in the case of applications).

    In the simple local dev case, there is no proxy, so we just use
    REMOTE_ADDR. When we are behind nginx, we use the standard X-Forwarded-For
    header.

    However, this header is additive per proxy, and can be easily spoofed. So
    we use a list of trusted proxy IP addresses to figure out which is the
    trusted source address. Note: we will probably strip it from nginx too,
    which also solves the problem, but we don't want to rely on that alone, as
    it could change.

    Note:  we are deliberately constraining this implementation to only support
    X-Forwarded-For in the standard format, because that's what nginx does.
    We're ignoring X-Real-IP and others, as well as unusual headers formats, as
    we only need this one specific case to work.

    Note: we attempted using the structlog dependency django-ipware for this,
    but its trusted proxy list support seems be incorrectly implemented.
