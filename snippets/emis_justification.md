OpenSAFELY is under rapid iteration and development and as a consequence the features and data available in the underlying data environments differ. Currently all approvals are granted to process the GP data held in the GP systems supplied by TPP (OpenSAFELY-TPP) by default and requests for EMIS (OpenSAFELY-EMIS) are considered by exception.

OpenSAFELY-EMIS approvals will be considered for:

- Studies where it is advantageous to have a complete national picture or a sample size greater than contained in OpenSAFELY-TPP.
- Studies that currently only involve GP data, or where no new bespoke feature/variable development is required.
- Studies where the applicant's team have advanced skills and can contribute to active development of the shared OpenSAFELY codebase for all subsequent users.
