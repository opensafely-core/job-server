There are two levels of access to OpenSAFELY available for researchers:

* **access to the OpenSAFELY results server (also referred to as the Level 4 environment)**
    * where you review your study results before applying disclosure controls and requesting their release to your GitHub repo.
    * only results necessary for discussion, or for inclusion in the final manuscript, report, or presentation, should be [requested for release.](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/)
    * we ask that you think very carefully about how many researchers apply for access to the OpenSAFELY results server. As a security measure, this should typically be the main study author only.

* **access to OpenSAFELY's GitHub organisation**
    * where you store your study code, which is then executed against the patient data held on the results server.
    * where you store results that have been released by the OpenSAFELY output-checkers from the results server (after you have applied the necessary disclosure controls).
    * these results, now "safe" (i.e. not disclosive), can be [shared IN CONFIDENCE and ONLY with key members of the wider research team / research collaborators](https://policies-for-researchers.opensafely.pages.dev/policies-for-researchers/#all-datasets-sharing) (principally for the purpose of seeking feedback and contribution to inform the final manuscript, report, or presentation).
    * However, any publication or wider sharing of results, will require [approval from NHS England](https://policies-for-researchers.opensafely.pages.dev/policies-for-researchers/#all-datasets-publication). NHS England has been extremely supportive of all research and analyses to date. The usual response time for approval is 1-2 weeks.

By default, all reseachers named in the following section will be provided with access to the OpenSAFELY GitHub organisation.
Of them, you will be asked to identify key researchers who require additional access to the OpenSAFELY results server.
