If you need assistance to determine if your work is research, service evaluation or audit, or help understanding the HRA process, in the first instance you should seek help from your [local NHS R&D Office](https://rdforum.nhs.uk/rd-contacts-directory/). 

Other helpful resources:

* the [HRA definitions of research, service evaluation and audit](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/docs/DefiningResearchTable_Oct2017-1.pdf)
* the [HRA “is it research” decision tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/)
* if  you are still unsure, email the HRA directly on <queries@hra.nhs.uk> (please contact OpenSAFELY to discuss further if necessary)

For reference, the [OpenSAFELY favourable Health Research Authority (HRA) opinion](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/open-corona-research-platform-phase-i-covid-19/).
