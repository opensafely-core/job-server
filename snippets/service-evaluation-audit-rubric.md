We will need the following information:

1. evidence that your study is a service evaluation or audit (e.g. from your [NHS R&D office](https://rdforum.nhs.uk/rd-contacts-directory/); from your institutional ethics committee agreeing it is a service evaluation/audit; by using the [HRA “is it research” decision tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/); or if you are still unsure, please contact the HRA for advice);

2. evidence of a favourable opinion from your institutional ethics review process/committee (not required by NHSE applicants);

3. evidence of support from a senior sponsor, usually an NHSE individual, such as a national clinical lead, band 9, director, or the sponsor might be a member of SAGE, JCVI, etc.

Note: for the existing approved Bennett Institute/LSHTM Service Restoration Observatory and Aftershocks workstream, sponsorship is not required, but may be requested on a case-by-case basis by the OpenSAFELY team.
