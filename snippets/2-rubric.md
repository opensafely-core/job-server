Currently the data held in OpenSAFELY can only be analysed for COVID-19 related purposes; see the [OpenSAFELY purposes for processes](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-response-information-governance-hub/the-nhs-england-opensafely-covid-19-service-privacy-notice) and the list of [approved projects](https://www.opensafely.org/approved-projects/) for examples.

Studies must not release any information that identifies or could identify STPs, Local Authorities (including MSOA identifiers), CCGs and individual GP practices (either directly, e.g. name. or indirectly e.g. list size).
